This is my practicum research project at the [**Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest**](https://www.baycrest.org/about-us-rri), supervised by [**Dr. Malcolm Binns**](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/binns-malcolm/). I also work closely with [**Dr. Howard Chertkow**](https://www.baycrest.org/Baycrest/Research-Innovation/People/Researchers/Scientists/Dr-Howard-Chertkow) (project conceptualization and funding) and [**Dr. Bruna Seixas Lima**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_0ls-AIAAAAJ&hl=en) (study curation). Our work focuses on analyzing cognitive profiles of individuals living with dementia using the Toronto Cognitive Assessment (TorCA) and advanced statistical modeling.
